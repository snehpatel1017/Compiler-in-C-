 # My C# Compiler

This is a simple C# compiler project created for learning purposes and to showcase coding skills. 
The compiler is implemented in C# and supports basic features such as parsing, loops, conditions, declarations,
scoping, syntax highlighting, and string data types.

# Features

* Parsing: The compiler parses input code written in C# syntax.
* Loops and Conditions: It supports loops (e.g., for, while) and conditional statements (e.g., if, else).
* Declarations: Variables and constants can be declared and used within the code.
* Scoping: Proper scoping rules are implemented to handle variable scope within blocks.
* Syntax Highlighting: The compiler provides syntax highlighting for better code readability.
* String Data Types: Strings are supported as a data type in the compiled code.
